# OpenCV_ClassAttendance
Automated class attendance system using OpenCV to detect & recognise students

The aim of this project is to implement a camera based solution that periodically takes a still image from a webcam and detects the faces
of students. The system will then recognise the students present and automatically update a class register database with attendance and 
information on latecoming.
